# Hello, I'm Nhi NGUYEN. ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Science student at CY Tech with a passion for data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving. I have experience working with Python, R, SQL, and Power BI, using these tools to clean, analyze, and extract insights from data.

Currently, I am looking for a 4â€“5 month internship starting in April 2025, where I can apply my skills, contribute to real-world projects, and continue learning in a professional environment.
