Hi! I'm Nhi NGUYEN, a Data Science student at CY Tech with a passion for data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving. I specialize in working with tools like Python, R, SQL, and Power BI, where I clean, analyze, and extract insights from data.

### My Story

I am currently seeking a 4â€“5 month internship starting in April 2025, where I can apply my data science skills in a real-world setting. I am eager to contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate with industry professionals, and continue growing as a data scientist. With a strong foundation in Python, R, SQL, and Power BI, I am passionate about turning data into actionable insights and solving complex problems.
