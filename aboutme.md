Hi! I'm [Your Name], a Data Science student at CY Tech with a passion for data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving. I specialize in working with tools like Python, R, SQL, and Power BI, where I clean, analyze, and extract insights from data.

### My Story

Currently, I am looking for a 4â€“5 month internship starting in April 2025, where I can apply my skills, contribute to real-world projects, and continue learning in a professional environment.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/yourusername) or check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername) to see my work!
