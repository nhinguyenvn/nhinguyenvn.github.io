As a **Data Science student at CY Tech**, Iâ€™ve developed a passion for using data to solve real-world problems, uncover insights, and drive decision-making. Hereâ€™s a selection of the projects that showcase my journey and growth as a data scientist.

### Project 1: **Houses in Melbourne**
**Description:**  
This project involved analyzing real estate data to predict house prices in Melbourne. Using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, I explored trends, cleaned the dataset, and created visualizations to identify key factors influencing house prices.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Project 2: **Data Wrangling â€“ Preprocessing PhD Dataset**
**Description:**  
For this project, I worked with a **PhD dataset** containing over 480,000 entries of students who defended their PhDs in France between 1985 and 2020. My goal was to explore issues like missing or unreliable data, generate graphs to visualize data quality issues, and use the **UpSet** package to analyze missing data patterns.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, UpSet, Data Cleaning

### Project 3: **Dimensional Reduction & Clustering**
**Description:**  
This project involved analyzing a **user profile dataset** from a data app to perform **dimensional reduction** and **clustering**. I used **PCA** to visualize quantitative variables and **MCA** to represent qualitative data, as well as applied clustering techniques to group similar profiles based on various features.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, PCA, MCA, Clustering

### Project 4: **Iris Dataset - PCA and Clustering**
**Description:**  
In this project, I analyzed the **Iris dataset**, which includes measurements of iris flowers. I used **PCA** to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and created a **scree plot** to determine the number of dimensions to keep for analysis. I also visualized clusters in the PCA space.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, PCA

### Project 5: **Tinder Messages Analysis**
**Description:**  
This project involved analyzing **Tinder conversation data** to identify patterns in message types (e.g., questions, affirmations, politeness). I used **sequence plots** and **heatmaps** to visualize message trends and applied **Traminer clustering** to analyze sequences of messages.

**Tech Stack:** R, Data Visualization, Clustering

### Project 6: **Text Mining â€“ PhD Dissertations**
**Description:**  
This project involved processing a dataset of **50 PhD dissertations** in PDF format. I converted the PDFs to text files, then applied **TF-IDF** and **cosine similarity** to assess document similarity. I also created a **forced directed graph** to visualize the strongest correlations between terms in the dissertations.

**Tech Stack:** Python, NLTK, TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity
